## About & Behind the Scenes

Hello! I'm thrilled to share this game project, which was developed during my internship at MoonRift in 2022. Project IOTA is one of two intern games I contributed to and marks my first completed Unity game project.

Project IOTA is a first-person puzzle game that revolves around exploring a base, reading datapads for clues, and evading holographic ghost-like enemies. Your objective is to complete tasks and eliminate all enemies to progress.
